# Set whitelist option to true if you want a list which includes the worlds to count kills in.
# If you enable the optimization you will lose the benefit of real-time leaderboards, but performance will improve.
# Set the leaderboard-update to how often you want the leaderboards to update (in seconds, works only with optimization on)
# If you enable kill-streak-reset then only player kills will reset killstreaks.
# If you enable kill-death-count then only player kills will be registered as deaths.
